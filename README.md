# cards-from-server

A simple page that shows the data from the fake server. The data was generated by Retool and fetching from JSON-Server. Cards can be sorted eitner by name or rating and searched by name - these are server-side operations. Also, here I used 'react-paginate' package to realize paginaton on the client-side.
